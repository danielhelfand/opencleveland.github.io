The Cleveland City Council, the legislative body of Cleveland, meets weekly. A record of the meeting includes proposals and votes of legislation, bid announcements for city contracts, Public Notices, Board of Zoning Appeal are published weekly in [The City Record](http://clevelandcitycouncil.org/the-city-record/) is only available as a PDF. 


## Long Term Goals:

* Scheduled refreshing to fetch latest records from city council site, extract the text, and load it into the website 

* Browsable interface to view the City Record

* Full-text search of the City Record, with some filters including date, Councilman, and parcel number and a web interface


### Where we are now: 

* [launch of prototype website available](http://cityrecord.openfordata.com/)
